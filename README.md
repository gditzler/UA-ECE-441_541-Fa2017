# ECE441a/541a - Automatic Control 

Repository for the contents of the University of Arizona's Automatic Controls Course. From time to time I will post example code related to the course and tutorials if needed. You are encouraged to issue a pull request to this repository if you find a bug or have some overall improvements to the code. Keep in mind that the pull requests will become tricky with the IPython notebooks.  

# Getting the Environment Setup

You need to have Python and several other libraries installed to be able to run many of the scripts that are in this notebook. I recommend that you use the Anaconda distribution of Python since it installs many of the required libraries with a basic install.

To run an IPython notebook, open a terminal window and move into the directory of the notebook then run 
```
ipython notebook
```

Your web browser will open with IPython then you can open the notebook. 

You are free to use Matlab as well; however, my examples will most likely be in Python.
